			The fates despise me!
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To taunt me with Death and snatch it from me, to let me crave it, 
			want it, ACCEPT it, and then deny me my release. 
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This account will in all likely-hood never see living eyes, nor 
			living eyes see it, yet I know this is written for no one's sake, but my own. 
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a man the worst thing he's ever done? Or the best of that which 
			he desires to be? And in the end who is it that judges these things? One does begin to doubt any final Justice,
			or even any peace. My story starts as many do, at the beginning, with the best intent. It goes wrong with the 
			wiles of a lascivious woman and the lust of men. 
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to believe that it was her powers alone that brought me
			to such nefarious actions, but in truth I suspect my Desires played part.  
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She came to me in my dreams at first, and then She came to me in the
			long, cold, desperate nights. At first I could tell the dreams of my mind from the reality of the world, yet She
			tempted me, She taunted me, and promised me, She goaded me with what we both knew I wanted. She was KATRINA and
			I was hers. 
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cry and might I pray for forgiveness, for the things I did under
			her sensual thrall. I did make war on my people, I made war on my father and Kin.
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made war with myself. 
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the people liberated me, I thought myself saved. But none
			would hear my story, and why should they? For, I had been as a terrible monster in all ways, and monsters do not 
			earn the mercy of men. 
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people hated me and I hated myself, I wanted Release from my 
			nightmare ~ I craved it. In a way I did die that night, but I still had no release. 
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She came to me that night, as so many times she had before. I thought
			it the final dream of a man that was soon to die. I lay, a sword through my gut, revelling in the poetic and final
			bloody demise, and she made me her own.  
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I do hideous things in her name.   
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this time ~ I am powerless to stop it. I rail against my new
			nature. Yet slowly I feel it consuming my entire being, I pray for a saviour. I fear, though, that none may come.

			Yet the Prince did find his saviours. A band of heroes led by Lord Silvermoon of Jurawicca risked the depths
			of the crypt, past deadly traps and vampire spawn, to where the Prince slept in his coffin in the daytime. By dint 
			their arcane research, they found a means to rescue the Prince from the vampiric blood-bond, and set him free. 
			Since then, the King of Mordavia has re-affirmed his son's place as the Lord of Berium.
