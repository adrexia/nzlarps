						Baron Glenn Underwood predictably denied questions (published in the last edition of the Mordavian Truth) as to whether or not he was, in fact, a Gypsy. The Mordavian Truth has since received independant confirmation of Baron Underwood's nobility and obtained a copy of his birth certificate that appears to be genuine. <br>

						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the resulting gathering, called by the Baron, the citizens of Berium unanimously called for resolve on the questions posed in the Mordavian Truth. The Baron avoided most of the questions, directing the crowd's attention to his new silken pants. The Truth wonders if, in his financially straitened position (see the article on the Mage’s Guild on p2), a little less attention to clothing might perhaps be in order.<br>

						<div class="newstitle">Curse On The House of Löwe? </div>
						There has been a rash of strange deaths and dissapearances associated with the Eranov Exporters Guild, formerly run by the late William Löwe. Löwe's funeral was interrupted by the murder of his butler, the hideously disfigured Abraham and the perpetrators have not yet been discovered. Löwe himself was murdered by persons unknown. Yet more recently, two of the Eranov Exporters’ journeymen, Tristan Lafours and Bors Meman, were apparently taken by violence in the night. Certainly, their lodging was broken into, their belongings disarranged and a chillingly large amount of blood was found. <br><br>
						<center><table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="newssmall" align="center"><img src="img/news/06/funeral.jpg"><br><br>Löwe’s Funeral</td></tr></table></center><br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a curse on the Löwe household?  Or is there a more mundane explanation -  before they were outlawed Eranov Exporters
						had well-established trade links with the Elvish kingdom of Jurrawicca.  Perhaps the Jurrawiccans are trying to use the Eranov Exporters as a source of supply in their ongoing guerilla war.<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master William Löwe Junior commented: “My father stated in his will that he had a lot of unfinished business and was ashamed of some of the things he did.  Any links to Jurrawicca are now cut. It is true tragedy that has befallen the Lowe house recently. The dissappearance of the two is sad and I have provided a pension for their families.”<br>

						<div class="newstitle">New Mage’s Guild In Financial Woes</div>
						The embryonic Berium Mage’s Guild is having financial troubles already.  The theologically named Aitrus Hellbringer abruptly cancelled a contract made in good faith with the Mordavian Truth.  No reason was given for this breach of contract and this publication asks if this shocking act was caused by insufficient seed money or instead bad management and an inability to budget by the Guild’s founders.<br>

 						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called Mage’s Guild is a very recent institution that has now begun to compete with other well established magical associations such as the Thyglore Mutual Magic League, the Esteemed Society of Astrologers and Thaumaturges and the Royal Carpathian University.  It was founded by two previously little known magicians, the self-titled High Mage Hellbringer and the vampire Heck Vestock.  The pair have begun advertising for apprentices and journeymen and have stated that applicants will be trained in the arts of magic.  Dr Whitetree of the Royal Carpathian University has, however, questioned their lack of teaching experience and recommends that those serious about their education should seek a teacher with a better known reputation.<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guild’s patron, Baron Underwood commented: “The guild is on loose footing at the present moment. The membership, too, is scarce. As such, the guild is almost entirely reliant on me for its expenses, and I, too, am on a tight budget - I've only just severed my financial dependence on my family, and as such my income has become slightly reduced."<br>

						<div class="newstitle">Borsa Swampbound</div>
						The fortified hilltop town of Borsa is now completely surrounded by Swamp. Ghouls and cultists prowl its perimeter. The Floating Road runs from Berium to Borsa, then north to the ever-expanding edge of the Swamp where it meets the road to Eranov and Dareen.<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former Duchy is now a Barony. The late Duke of Borsa killed his three children during the Great Depression, and there is no successor. Sir Lucien has been made steward of Borsa.

Admirers reportedly range from the intrepid explorer Sebastien Creed and her employer Baron Glenn Underwood. While our sources were unable to determine if the debutante returns any of her hopeful beau's affections, a group of potato farmers have formed a fanclub in her honour. <br>

						The sacred Staff of Erana has been brought to the Royal City of Carpathia as part of its progress around Mordavia. The King declared a week long holiday in its honour and many of Carpathia's citizens have flocked to pray in the newly consecrated Temple of Erana. Lady Alia of the Order said that she was "pleased and delighted at the upwellings of popular support" the Order has been receiving. <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next sites in the itinerary of the procession are the elvish town of Elendar and the forests of Sylvania. Sources close to the Prince of Eranov are refusing to comment on rumours that he may accompany the progress as part of his quest for a bride.<br>

						For firstly, you need to be born a Fairy. You aren't one. Be thankful for this - Peasanting is an honest and worthy profession in which one plants apples and potatoes and other food type things for the benefit of all. <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For secondly, you need to have skill and grace. You don't. Just accept that. Peasants are not and will never be graceful.  It would disrupt the Divine Chain of Being.<br>
