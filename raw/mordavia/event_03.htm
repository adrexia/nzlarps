							<b><i>Scott Farndon</i></b><br>

							<br>
Well here we are back in the real world after another insane Mordavian weekend. The sudden snap back to reality is rather harsh on my old bones, arriving home at a respectable hour (for a change) to find myself completely unfamiliar with my own hovel. This forgetfulness can only mean one thing, that Mordavia was successful at taking people away from the real world, and given them all a brief break from angry customers, crazy phones and other such real life evils.
<br><br>
I have noticed that costumes have improved greatly, and was very impressed with all of the players for putting that extra effort in their own costumes. The NPC group have been working many hours in an attempt to bring players new creatures and improved costumes and in saying that, feel that we are getting closer to providing an almost believable environment.  
<br><br>
I apologize to any players who felt that the time I choose to debrief players was inappropriate. In my own defence I believe it was a very good time as we find after a game players and NPC�s are both rushed to clean both buildings and in a even madder rush to get home and prepare for the days ahead. However the information we have gathered is already being put to use and some future changes are bound to happen for the better. 
<br><br>
A very big thank you to Steve and help, in the NPC squad for coming up with the idea of creating that lumbering beast of a stone golem, I regret not seeing it in combat but we now have a video clip of it in action on the website. Another very big thank you to Gareth and Dylan for restoring the Necrotaur and making improvements, after the second game this creature was looking rather destroyed, fear had forced many a player to beat the NPC playing the part mercilessly and the end result was half the face was destroyed and claws broken. To avoid favoritism, a final big thanks to the whole NPC crew for attending and giving the players a good game.
<br><br>
Some really good thinking on the players� part did occur. For example Hingen finding a lock door scroll to seal out monsters on Saturday night kept us from attacking the township, and other such brilliance was presented during game, but the responsible players must tell these stories. All in all both sides came up with some real beauties and I found myself quietly chuckling to myself when informed of particular actions. The good plot lines, experienced Game Masters, and cunning players made this event exciting; we all deserve a pat on the back.
<br><br>
Finally I must make one last apology in regards to my particular behavior on the Saturday night. Although I had a ball with a few of the players while slightly tipsy, I did destroy the gaming environment by dropping out of character. In a sense I guess I was celebrating my last night as an active Mordavian Organiser. For those who are unaware I am retiring from the Organiser scene for a while, after many years I am experiencing a bit of a burn out and finding it hard to come up with new and interesting ideas for you the players to enjoy. However this is not the end, Ryan will be continuing on with Mordavia with the help of the Game Masters and the experience of both old Portal gamers and my group of LARPing companions who have been with me since the days of my younger teenage years. With this wealth of experience and skill I feel Mordavia is in good hands and will continue to grow and improve as it matures. Although I have retired from Organising for now, you will still see me in game amongst the madness of the players as one of them. 
<br><br>
Thank you all for your attendance and I hope the Mordavian experience has been a memorable one and I look forward to seeing you at the next installment of this mad fest.
<br><br>

First up, I'd like to thank the NPCs, Players, GMs, writers and everyone else involved (including our gypsy chef).  Well done to you all and thanks heaps for all your hard work and commitment. Things like the Golem were magnificient works of art, and the Orc vrs. Players scene was definitely one of my favourites.  
<br><br>
One of the things I wasn't too impressed about was the drinking.  It did spoil the game a bit to see NPCs and Players dropping out of character etc but that aside, the game was excellent.
<br><br>
I'm definitely going to play again next year (maybe as a NPC for variety) and I recommend this to great larp anyone! P.S.  I also wouldn't mind catching up with anyone so just email me, <a href="mailto:alexv@i4free.co.nz">alexv@i4free.co.nz</a>.

<i>Thanks Alex. Our new policy is BYO alchohol only. We hope that those who do bring alchohol to future games are moderate with it - a few drinks can be pleasant but we don't think inebriation has any place in a live roleplaying event.</i>

God, wasn't that just the best? I'm still absolutely buzzing on the experience, which was second to none.
<br><br>
I feel the Land's Need "raised the bar" and showed us all what Mordavia is about. The costumes, character consistancy and setup of the game really brought out the environment of Berium, flowing seamlessly from adventure to banter to terror and back again.
<br><br>
Oh, the Friday night. I, personally was done up as a particularly fearsome ghoul. I hid in the shadows and pounced upon unexpecting players. At one point, writhing and hissing on the ground, I bit a poor player's ankle. I've never heard a grown man shriek like he did that night. 
There's just something about attempting to strangle someone to death then being hogtied, impaled and destroyed by holy powers that gives you those warm fuzzies.
<br><br>
I felt it justified to make a few appearances as slightly less troubled characters as well. Take my word for it - I'm not that bad a guy.
<br><br>
Saturday was a real treat for all involved. From being involved in the debrief, I know that the opportunity to take their frustration with society out on a neverended band of smelly orcs was a real hit with the players. Time, and time again I roared battle cries and charged shield first into the swarms of players, ever galantly defending one another.
<br><br>
Saturday night held my precious catacombs. I was pleased with how the technical rig went for that - considering most of the sound was engineered on the spot. I knew from the occasional voices inside that cardboard tunnel, that the fear of god was in its victims. NPCs dotted the area outside, sitting with huge grins on their faces and eating movie snacks. Those lucky enough to squeeze through those tunnels saw first hand the result of hours of hard work.
<br><br>
That Friday morning I had decided it was a good idea to take a technical rig to the LARP festival. Next time, there will be much more planning for where sound and lighting enhancements can be made, and I'll work alongside the GMs to get innovative theatrical designs working in several places.
<br><br>
All in all I think the game was evidence that we should do this more often and charge more for it. I don't doubt that this was the most sucessful Mordavia yet, and that the event will continue to advance in leaps and bounds next time around.

That was, by far, the most fun I have ever had. A big hand to all the 
organisers and GM's for putting on such a great weekend. Just like Scott, I 
felt very overwelmed by the modern world on my return to it. In fact, I 
still do. It is now Friday the 16th of May as I write this email and I am 
still constantly thinking back to Mordavia both when I'm awake and in my 
dreams. To cause that type of thinking in me, it should be punishable by 
death to refer to The Land's Need as anything less than a success.
<br><br>
The winner of my "Extra Special Thumbs Up" Award (I'm going to make this 
something I do after every game) can only be Eamon Zink for his creativity. 
The ideas that came from him ranged from amazingly brutal to so funny I'm 
still laughing about them. One that gets special mention would be his 
"Greatest Dueler In The World" performance. It was truly zany event when 
acted out and although he didn't see it I'm sure we did justice to his 
original vision.
<br><br>
Finally, a huge thank you to both the players and NPCs. It was, above all, 
the combined efforts of these two parties that made the event so enjoyable.
<br><br>
My only complaint would be, of course, those damned latex Orc masks. I know 
latex is cheap and easy to make masks from but all the NPCs can relate to 
how horrible it is to wear. However, I have a very small head so the type of 
mask used for the Dark Ones were no good either. Damn my small head! If I 
could make a suggestion, it could be good to coat the inside of the latex 
with a material which isn't so sticky and bind the masks at the back of our 
heads with elastic or shoelaces. This way, we can have the Orcish look of 
the latex mask without having to suffer so much.
<br><br>
Once again, thanks to the Organisers and I hope to see everyone there next 
time.
<br><br>

<i>Crikey, I've got a little tear in my... no, it's just some dust. You nancy boys complaining about orc masks. When I was a boy, we'd eat a nice chewy orc mask for breakfast every day, and wash it down with a tasty cup of cold facial sweat. But seriously, good idea on the soft lining, let's look into it at the next workshop. Also, I've got to agee about Patch (Eamon), he did exactly the fine kind of GMing job we've come to expect from him. Kudos!</i>

First, thanks to all the GMs, especially David and Steve for constructing that labyrinth. Big thanks to Ryan, your ability to oversee, organise and coordinate all of the plot without ever getting upset at confused NPCs is truly appreciated. 
<br><br>
I agree with the common consensus, Land's Need did "raise the bar". The costumes were great (stone golem!), the four concurrently running plots ensured no "players' block", and there was just the right ratio of fighting to plot. Yay! 
<br><br>
You may remember me from such roles as the elf up a tree. For an hour in a half I watched players, waiting for the perfect moment for my surprise attack. But I didn't break my cover because it was fun to sit back in the tree and observe the action. Later I haunted a few players (or at least confused them) with my whistling from the trees. Later friday night I played Sadako, the white ghost with long black hair (thanks to anyone who actually got my japanese pop culture reference!). Twas fun to stop and stay still for a while and then lurch foward suddenly and watch the players jump back. Eventually I stuffed the costume and hung the corpse from a tree with a belt and it had disappeared by the time I woke up on Saturday morning. Anybody have any idea where it went? I hope Eamon got his belt back. 
<br><br>
The Orc fortress scene was a great opportunity to play the "die in the most dramatic way possible" game (for the NPCs at least). Later, I found myself up in a tree with a bow again attempting to assasinate an orc diplomat. Thanks to whoever made those bows (Lincoln?), they were great. 
<br><br>
And thanks if you're reading this, because then you probably played and thus helped make the weekend what it was.

<i>Cheers Alex. Didn't you also play the Lord of Nightmares on Saturday night at the tower? Hope I've got the right picture...</i>

Hah don't be rushing me. I figure out this board of keys for soon now.
<br><br>
Very nice peoples, and wonderful creatures. Helga enjoy fine effort put into plots. Kudos there also.
<br><br>
Still no sign of goats, not yet, although I meet half a goat who talk clever. This is promising. Horrible dream not so promising, but think nightmare has gone. Helga apologise for screaming at night - most unseemly - but two floating rau� augr she sees! Much uneasiness!
<br><br>
Food is very good. Helga enjoys the tea of Apples very much. 
<br><br>
Some appear to be another self at times. Am thinking the consumption of �l have bearing upon this - when loudly so, this is disconcert, although quieter talkings not so bad. Helga understand that some peoples need to talk as if they in future world from time to time. (Slightly puzzled, but shrugs.)
<br><br>
I go consult runes for next time I think.
<br><br>
�akk!

Yes - what she said. ;)
<br><br>
There were some great "moments" in the playing, and I think that's what makes the whole thing really enjoyable. It was like discovering gems of fun, which were subsequently polished at every retelling. I can see why my friends were insistent that I would enjoy this. (thanks guys!)
<br><br>
I especially enjoyed the depth that some of the GM characters had - their characters were really solid, and their improvising was excellent. Had this been a stage play, I would be an avid audience. And I add to the chorus - The Golem rocked! (no pun intended...) The "red eyed" wanderers added great atmosphere also! This was my first LARP, and I hope to be back for another, to paraphrase a familiar title, it was like a Long Dark Playtime of the Soul!
<br><br>
Driving to work the next day, I was watching complete strangers cross the road, and idly wondering what their backgrounds were - and what advantages they had.. ;) It was a bit sad being back in the box.
<br><br>
I'd love to have the opportunity to catch up with you all again - I look forward to it.

<i>Thanks for the reminder about staying in character. At the next game we'll be having a "chill-out" area where players and NPCs can chat quietly out of character. Everywhere else (apart from the bathrooms) will be 100% in character, with the only exception being quiet briefings with GMs. We want Mordavia to be the most immersive experience it can be. After the game, probably on the Sunday evening, we'll have an after-LARP where everyone can get to know each other out of character.</i>

Firstly, big ups to the GMs and other NPC crew. That was a fully wicked experience, and the effort they put in really paid off in a professional, enjoyable game where their ideas really came to life.
<br><br>
Particular highlights for me included:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* The orc battle - fast, frantic, furious and looonnnggg - yeah !<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* Sneaking past the guards into the Prince's Keep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* The catacombs - the lighting, sound and pure claustrophobia of it all was crazy!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* That stone golem - can't wait to see it in action again
<br><br>
This was my first LARP experience where roleplaying was a major focus of the game (vs <a href="http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~mikaere/Skirmish.html">Skirmish</a> where the focus is on the live action aspect). I found the mix of live action and roleplaying exactly right, and I particularly enjoyed getting involved in as many major and minor plots as possible.
<br><br>
The game mechanics work well and the fact that mages can wear armour and use decent weapons is excellent.
<br><br>
I'm definitely coming along to the next game, and hope to bring a few more Skirmishers along as well.

Firstly, I would like to say that the Mordavia weekend was a prime contender for the "Best Weekend Of My Life" awards.
<br><br>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/dariyan_celebfin_thoronhen/mordavia">Part of one of my websites</a> is devoted to Mordavia... telling the story of events as I saw them. I also have some info about my character on there. 
<br><br>
Comments about the game.
<br><br>
The only things I found annoying were minor - certain people not being quiet when I was trying to sneak; a bit of a lull in the action on Saturday evening where people were just hanging around; my toes beginning to hurt in my boots esp. on Sunday; and the sad fact that it was all over on Sunday afternoon and I had to go back home and act like a 'normal person' again! not fair!
<br><br>
I lament that I did not show my Elven letter to more people (especially since I now seem to have lost it - maybe I will have to make another) I'll have to have some kind of pouch to put papers in next time - maybe I will sew a pocket on the inside of my chainmail? Ooh - and I am making a new weapon which I will probably bring to the next one, it is REALLY odd, sort of a crescent moon blade-shield-thing for the left arm with spikes and an arm guard.
<br><br>
Really neat touches I particularly liked about the game: the WANTED posters hung up in the Tavern, the Nightmare wandering round on Friday night (I confess - I did NOT hear anyone scream on any night... I must sleep like a log) the madman wandering round with his 'precious', and of course the stone golem!
<br><br>
Believe it or not, I want to thank Cucchalin the Gypsy for bringing his guitar, even though I wasn't amazingly happy with it at the time... it allowed me to play in my character more effectively (even though I was practically unable to spend much time lounging in the warmth of the tavern) I'll put up an explanation on my webpage.
<br><br>
I enjoyed Andreassa's piping (while inwardly laughing at her devotion to 'the one god'); I loved fighting
the Orcs in that huge pitched battle, especially running the Orc archer down with my shield; that bit
on Friday night when we followed the troll into the forest and were ambushed by Orcs really freaked me
out; Helga's questions about her goats were a nice touch; the formation drill was kind of fun!; and I
enjoyed fighting with Toa Kata and Kylen and everyone... and I'm glad I managed to convince Kelly and Jessie to come cause the females were seriously understrength!
<br><br>
More people should join Skirmish as well as it was really good. Lots of gingernuts. Also good training, one on one for about two hours.
<br><br>
Thanks to EVERYONE who participated in any way to make this weekend all it was - and special thanks to the monsters we got to beat up!
