			<center><img src="img/titles/faq_policies.gif" border="0" width="336" height="37"></center>
			<br>
			<div class="body">
			The policies below are common sense. We're describing them here for 
			those people who have a different kind of "common sense". Both players and crew are asked to adhere to this. 
			<br><br>

			<div class="largetitle">Safety</div>
			<br>
			<div class="title">Weapons and Armour</div>
			Your weapons and armour will be checked for safety when you arrive at the event. Weapons will be failed if they are too heavy, too hard, or otherwise dangerous. Armour with sharp or rough edges or projections will be failed.  
			<br><br>
			<div class="title">Combat</div>
			The most important combat rules are the safety rules. You must keep these rules in mind whenever you go into combat. If you violate these rules, we will remove your weapons for a period of time or ask you to leave the event. We are particularly concerned about players or crew striking too hard. If you see other players or crew members striking too hard, mention it to them out of character. If they carry on then inform a GM, preferably the Player GM for the event. If the person you are fighting against is striking too hard, that is no reason to hit them hard back. Ask them out-of-character to pull their blows. 
			<br><br>

			<div class="largetitle">Legal Issues</div>
			<br>
			<div class="title">Drugs</div>
			This event takes place at a scout camp. Anyone who uses illegal drugs on the grounds will be asked to leave. 
			<br><br>

			<div class="title">Alcohol</div>
			Our policy on alcohol is BYO only. Players or crew who are of legal drinking age can bring alcohol to the game and leave it behind the bar at the tavern. On Friday or Saturday night they can ask for it from the crew working at the tavern. They will not be charged in-game money. If you offer alcohol to underage players, you'll be asked to leave. If underage players want to roleplay drinking, we suggest they bring something like ginger beer and pretend it's ale. 
			<br><br>
			While a few drinks in the tavern is nice, intoxication is not compatible with LARP. For safety reasons and to help ensure a pleasant atmosphere please be moderate.   
			<br><br>		

			<div class="title">Other</div>
			Out-of-character theft, harassment, or any equally undesirable activity will not be tolerated. 
			<br><br>

			<div class="largetitle">Roleplaying</div>
			<br>
			<div class="title">Staying in Character</div>
			Mordavia is 42 hours of live roleplaying. Please don't drop out of character inappropriately. You may find it tempting to say something humorously modern to "break the tension". Resist the temptation. If other players start talking OOC ignore them, don't join in. If you want to talk OOC, save it for an appropriate time and place. 
			<br><br>
			There are only three times at which it is appropriate to talk OOC:<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) when talking quietly to a GM<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) in case of a real-life emergency or to warn other players they are playing dangerously<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) in designated out of character areas. 
			<br><br>
			
			<div class="title">Out of Character Areas</div>
			We are going to have a designated chill out area where people can take a break from the game and chat OOC. The chill out area is the small deck out the back of the Inn. If it's raining, the chill out area will be moved to the far end of the large hall (not the tavern). The bathrooms at the Inn will also be OOC areas. Everywhere else in the game is in-character.  
			<br><br>
			Please don't abuse the OOC areas. Generally monsters will not attack you there because you are considered to be OOC, like having your hands on your head. However, do not use the OOC area as a safe haven from attacks by either monsters or fellow players, as that violates the spirit of the game. If a player does use the OOC area to "hide", they shouldn't be surprised if they get attacked anyway. This also goes for cases where there is a full-scale attack on the Inn: anyone in the OOC area during such an event is likely to be fair game. 
			<br><br>
			Don't tell each other in-game secrets in the OOC area. The game is much more fun if you find stuff out during play. If you want to talk about events in the game, do it in character. Stories about your character's adventures are perfect roleplaying material. 
			<br><br>
	
			<div class="title">The Crew War Room</div>
			The Crew War Room is the large hall opposite Berium Keep. If you are a player and need to speak to a GM, please try to find one that is currently in the field. There is usually a Player GM staying at the Inn, who is always available to handle player requests. All inquiries should go to the Player GM first. He will communicate with the other GMs and rest of the crew. If your character dies or you can't find a Player GM, go to the War Room and ask for a GM from outside. Don't wander into the War Room, this area is out-of-bounds to players.  
			<br><br>
			Because monsters and NPCs are briefed and costumed in the War Room, monsters may sometimes be seen leaving the building. Players should avoid hanging around this area as it makes it difficult to put NPCs into the field discretely.
