  			<p class="p2">Chimera is proud to offer brand new games as well as reruns of popular games that have been run at other conventions. This list will grow as new larps are accepted into Chimera. Click the title of a larp for more information and a cast list.</p>
  			<p class="p1"><a href="larp_the_flight_of_the_hindenburg.htm">The Flight of the Hindenburg</a></p>

  			<span><img src="airship.jpg" style="float:right;width=25%"></span>
  			<p class="p2">It's the 1930s, and you are a guest aboard the airship Hindenberg, the largest aircraft to ever fly. For the airship's premiere flight from New York a special charity gala is being hosted to raise money for local shelters and soup kitchens. Expect gangsters, dashing heroes, Nazis, glamorous stars and much, much more!</p>
  			<p class="p2">The Flight of the Hindenburg accomodates up to 65 players, and will run on the Saturday night of Chimera as the centrepiece.</p>

  			<p class="p1"><a href="larp_tryst_illumination.htm">Tryst ~ Illumination</a></p>
 			<p class="p2">Tryst juxtaposes the reality of mundane life with supernatural surrealism, highlighting the magic of the everyday world.</p>
 			<p class="p2">Illumination is set in a scout camp, the very one where the convention Chimera takes place. But instead of a larp convention, the characters are attending a Buddhist meditation retreat. Some of the characters are regular retreat visitors, others are visiting to see what their friends and family are so taken with. Some have concerns about the nature of the retreat. Most players will portray a character very much like themselves. Others will portray otherworldly characters, invisible to most people.</p>
 			<p class="p2">Reality has broken. Can it be fixed?</p>

  			<p class="p1"><a href="larp_soap_opera.htm">Soap Opera Larp</a></p>
 			<p class="p2">A lighthearted, satirical freeform larp that takes advantages of the convoluted melodrama of the soap opera genre to create a larp that unfolds differently each time it is played.</p>
  			<p class="p2">This game includes innovative game principles from Jeepform.</p>

  			<p class="p1"><a href="larp_serenity_state_of_the_union.htm">Serenity: Too Pretty To Die<br>"State of the Union"</a></p>
 			<p class="p2">It's Unification Day! Tall ships (luxury cruise liners of the black) have entered orbit above Bridgewater, and the celebrities and tourists aboard are seeking to meet the settlers and share in the celebrations to commemorate the Unification of Planets, and the end of the war.</p>

  			<p class="p1"><a href="larp_for_the_honour_of_the_family.htm">For the Honour of the Family </a></p>
 			<p class="p2">7th June, 1826. For centuries, the Cantacuzio family, a powerful and ancient house, has been at the centre of Wallachian politics. They have endured much over the centuries in their attempt to build and ultimately profit from a just and strong Wallachian society. But now the head of the house, Duna Cantacuzino, has suddenly died and with the traditional mourning rites observed, the family must gather and choose the new head of house before the next new moon leaves the dusk horizon. Suspicions abound over Duna's death, ambitions clash and strong family ties are tested against ruthless Wallachian politics.</p>

  			<p class="p1"><a href="larp_graduation_day.htm">Graduation Day</a></p>
 			<p class="p2">The independent city-state of Tourmaline is ruled by the wizards of the White College. Prince Ambrose, the younger son of the King of neighbouring Arlandia, was sent to the White College to receive a gentleman's education. To the surprise of many he actually passed his final exams. Today Prince Ambrose is holding the traditional graduation feast to honour the College Masters.</p>
			
			<p class="p1"<a href="larp_nightmare_circle.htm">Nightmare Circle: The Return</a></p>
 			<p class="p2">Arkham's popular eccentric, Cyrus Crane, went missing several months ago in the mountains as he hunted for occult relics. Now, a miracle has happened, Cyrus has returned alive, and he has invited all his friends to a dinner to celebrate his homecoming.</p>
  			
			<p class="p1"><a href="larp_bad_dreams.htm">Bad Dreams: Purgatory</a></p>
 			<p class="p2">Three years ago, a wealthy, upper class recluse was found dead. Albert Tenneford Trismegistus died of natural causes, a heart attack, could happen to anyone, especially at such an old age. But you don't believe that for a second now do you? Escaping responsibility is easy in our world. Now open your eyes, see how easy it is in the next.</p>

			<p class="p1"><a href="larp_knightshade.htm">Knightshade</a></p>
 			<p class="p2">The land around the village of Puketane is filled with dread. The animals are skittish & fearful & in the fields the crops have been found rotting & blighted as they grow, in a weird parody of how things should be. And this northern area of Skorland has begun to attract another type of strangers. They are those like you, for good or for ill, those who are drawn to places of woe and need alike.</p>

			<p class="p1"><a href="larp_orcball.htm">Orcball</a></p>
 			<p class="p2">Fast moving and furious, Orcball combines sport with boffer weaponary. Teams of five will compete for the honour of being the first winner of the Chimera Cup.</p>

  			<p class="p1">Requiem</p>
 			<p class="p2">Details to be announced.</p>
